# Lift MongoDB Project

[g8](http://github.com/n8han/giter8) template to get a Lift-MongoDB webapp up and running quickly. The template generates a project that uses [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and implements the [Mongoauth Lift Module](https://github.com/eltimn/lift-mongoauth). It uses SBT 0.11.0 as the build tool. It has not been tested with other versions of SBT.

## Usage

Install SBT 0.11.x - [Setup](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Setup) for more information.

In a shell, run the following in the parent directory of the new project:

    g8 eltimn/lift-mongo
    cd <project-name>

Please see the README file in your new project for further instructions on configuring and running your app.
